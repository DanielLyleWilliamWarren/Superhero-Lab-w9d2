A Day in the Life of a Superhero

It was a cold a snowy night when the ice dragon from mount doom awoke and swooped in to decimate the small fishing village of Glasgow. Our superhero dealt with it and went to bed after seeing off about 10 pints in the boozer.

Once upon a time a superhero woke up. She was tired of fixing all mess made by the humans. So she stayed at home, watched and ate ice cream.
